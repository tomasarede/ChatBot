1 - The jupyter notebook with the intermediate tasks is called PF_Lab3.ipynb;
    Note that on the notebook some filepaths must be changed !

2 - The report pdf file is called lab3_IEEE_template_group10_SLP.pdf;

3 - The for the main task we decide to create a webapp. 
    For this we implemented everything that was described on the report.
    Open Ai whisper base + Qwen + Kokoro
    Also implemented gemini 2.0 flash

To run it you must:
3.1 : install the packages of requirement.txt (if you can't you can see the imports of the file app.py and try to download one by one)
3.2 : also need to run brew install ffmpeg
3.3 : then run app.py and test it :)

4 - A video demo is also available on this link https://youtu.be/dx3BoAoKp2U
